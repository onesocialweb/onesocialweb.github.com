				<h1>Why use XMPP?</h1>
				
				<h2>What XMPP has 
				to offer</h2>
				<p>We believe that 
				XMPP, the engine best known for its instant messaging capabilities, 
				can serve as a solid foundation for the new social web. There are several 
				similarities that can be leveraged: </p>
				<ul class="bullets">
				  <li>A unique identifier 
				  called jabber ID or JID e.g. alice@wonderland.lit in a familiar e-mail 
				  like format </li>
				  <li>A profile with basic 
				  information about you (in the shape of the upcoming vcard xml spec &amp; 
				  avatar)</li>
				  <li>A list of friends (the 
				  so called roster) </li>
				  <li>A means to share events 
				  of individuals (called Personal Eventing Protocol or PEP)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>A tremendous advantage 
				of XMPP is that in its very nature it tackles security issues that are 
				not straight forward to solve in the web world. Since all traffic is 
				routed through the server and the identity of that server can be validated 
				with signatures issued by Certified Authorities, end users do not need 
				to worry about complex things like signatures to establish secure communication. 
				Like in the email world the trust is at the server level: the server 
				is expected to behave according to several rules. </p>
				<p>Another advantage 
				is that xmpp has been designed to send all messages in real-time using 
				a very efficient push mechanism. Existing web or polling based mechanisms 
				are often making many unnecessary requests introducing network load 
				and are not real-time.</p>
				<p>Finally XMPP is 
				already a distributed social web in its own right for the purpose of 
				chatting. With several subtle modifications it could very quickly become 
				a full fledged social web with substantial critical mass.</p>
				<h2>What XMPP is 
				still lacking</h2>
				<p>To realise our 
				vision the XMPP foundations would need to be extended and complemented 
				with the following elements:</p>
				<ul class="bullets">
				  <li>Activities: the core 
				  elements shared on social networks. We are using the ActivityStrea.ms 
				  standard for this purpose. This is the de-facto standard and a 1.0 release 
				  is expected soon.</li>
				  <li>Fine grained access 
				  control: we want to enable both public oriented Twitter like social 
				  nodes as well as more private oriented Facebook like social nodes. For 
				  this we think it is essential to include fine grained access control 
				  at a protocol level. With fine-grained we mean that end users have precise 
				  control on who can see or do what: for activities on a per activity 
				  basis, for profiles on a field per field basis. This is not only about 
				  viewing rights, you could also delegate editing or updating to third 
				  parties e.g. you could allow a location provider to update your location.</li>
				  <li>Subscriptions: we allow 
				  anyone to subscribe to another’s activity, profile or relation updates 
				  again with fine grained control e.g. maybe you only want to get photo’s 
				  or blog posts from someone. This to keep the user in control and avoid 
				  information overload. Subscriptions can be asynchronous, can be setup 
				  without friending and respect relevant access control rules. You only 
				  receive what you are allowed to see.</li>
				  <li>Collaboration: this 
				  is a different flavour related to fine grained access control. You can 
				  allow others to edit or work together on projects or tasks e.g. a shared 
				  photo album. </li>
				  <li>Relations: you can define 
				  the nature of the relationships of your friends e.g. colleague or fiancé. 
				  Relations can be confirmed or declined. We add a mechanism for anyone 
				  to validate a claimed relationship.</li>
				  <li>Offline message store: 
				  if a user is offline, normal chat messages are dropped. We need to add 
				  an offline message store that stores messages when you are not online. 
				  We will effectively put all messages you get in a database so end users 
				  can navigate backwards in time. </li>
				</ul>
				<p>Activities, profile 
				and relations would have to be extensible to accommodate unforeseen 
				future use cases. All the existing standards we selected are employing 
				extensible xml formats using name spaces. </p>
				<h2>The role of the 
				web</h2>
				<p>Does this mean 
				there is no role to play for the web? We believe that the web will remain 
				a very important place to discover, consume and publish social activities 
				as well as people’s profiles. Moreover we think that http based interfacing 
				(e.g. via REST) for now will remain the de facto way of communicating 
				between social web clients and servers. That is why we are including 
				a web client for OneSocialWeb and eventually will include a REST API 
				for client to server communication.</p>
				<p>We foresee that 
				in the future you can selectively expose activities and parts of your 
				profile transparently through your browser when you are browsing the 
				web. You could for instance authorize Amazon when you visit their website 
				to read your book reviews and recommend relevant books to you without 
				having to login.</p>
				<h2>XMPP on the mobile</h2>
				<p>OneSocialWeb enabled 
				clients can work on mobile phones just like existing social network 
				or chat clients on the market place, either using web based APIs or 
				native XMPP. To offer real-time notification, it is important that the 
				mobile platform supports background threads (otherwise you always need 
				to have the app activated) and that the client uses native XMPP. Since 
				XMPP has really different characteristics, we are implementing an Android 
				client to understand connectivity issues when switching bearers or reconnecting 
				(2G/3G/WIFI/No network), network traffic implications (XMPP by default 
				broadcasts presence changes of your complete roster, but is otherwise 
				highly efficient) and overall impact on battery life. </p>
